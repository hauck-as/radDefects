radDefects
##########
``radDefects`` is a framework to analyze properties of radiation-induced defects in semiconductor materials from first principles using ``VASP``.
``radDefects`` extends the analysis tools for single point defects from other codes including ``pydefect``, ``doped``, and ``pymatgen-analysis-defects`` to facilitate analysis of radiation-induced defect configurations such as Frenkel pairs and defect clusters.

Installation
------------
Currently, there is no automatic installation method available. The files may be either downloaded manually or using ``git clone``.

-----
Usage
-----
``radDefects`` scripts may currently be called from the command line with Python. More streamlined CLIs will be added.
